## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Medicine & Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am currently supervised by [Prof Jean Woo](https://www.mect.cuhk.edu.hk/people/jeanwoo.html).

Before coming to CUHK, I received my Master's degree in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from Peking University in 2021 under the supervision of [Prof Beibei Xu](https://medic.bjmu.edu.cn/jyjx/szll/index.htm). I also got my Bachelor's degree in Medicine from PKU in 2019. 

I am interested in exploring the social determinants of intrinsic capacity using cross-national aging cohort data.
