## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong. I am currently supervised by [Prof Qingpeng Zhang](https://datascience.hku.hk/people/qingpeng-zhang/).

Before coming to CityU, I received my Master's degree in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from Peking University in 2022 under the supervision of [Prof Beibei Xu](https://medic.bjmu.edu.cn/jyjx/szll/index.htm). I also got my Bachelor's degree in Medicine from PKU in 2020. 

I am interested in using machine learning approaches to identify social determinants and biological markers of diseases and aging. I welcome opportunities for research collaboration and discussions.
